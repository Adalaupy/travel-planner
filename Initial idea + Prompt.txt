I want to build a React app (responsive for both tablet, PC and mobile) for travel planning with almost zero-cost, skip any charging API, below is the basic idea of my app.
Help to think about the architecture of the app.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General:
1. Plan your personal trip
2. Clerk login
3. Explore Common Itinerary (pending, can skip now)
	-> Click and go to others detail page (no edit button)
	-> click to clone others location (user have to choose the your own trip and select date)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The apps can build more multiple trips, and for each of the trip, the function should be like below:

1. Packing checklist:
- add, delete and updates items
- click to mark complete and incomplete
- drag and drop the items to re-order them
- coloring for easy categorizing --> update state of your latest picked color for next new item



2. Add friends : people who travel together
- input traveler name + email for co-working
- for further sharing cost function
- Icons (with free icon library) --> better distinguish the identity



3. Destination Planning (Itinerary)
- input Title, Google Map link, remark, url for more detail (e.g. website of the  destination), date range (or include time)
	- display time if provided
	-> Title as display card title
	-> Google Map Link: trigger function to explore the page and capture the place name (both Eng. , Chinese etc.) , latitude, longitude, iframe html
- day by day (e.g. if 6 days, 6 sub tabs with specific date in yyyy-mm-dd)
- with ordering, drag and drop to allow re-order
- Generate two google map link ( "a" or "button" element), format: "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=[From]&destination=[to]"
	-> 1. From you current location to destination: "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=My+Location&destination=[encoded address]"
	-> 2. From previous location to destination
- Google Maps URL parser to display google map, click on it and route to google map



4. Cost Calculation
- Input:
	-> By Event(e.g. Lunch, Dinner, Transportation) or Link to above location 
	-> price
	-> input datetime, or now
	-> who paid the bill (from point 2)
	-> charge to (not include paid person) (from point 2)
- Calculate the amount that users owe/paid
- Get total expenditure/ per traveler


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other details of the App

- Framework: NextJs + TypeScript
- Login authentication: Clerk
- Drag and Drop Function: dnd kit (useSortable)
- Database: Dexie.js
	-> all table must linked to their parent table, e.g. Place must have foreign key: TripID
	-> All foreign keys must Named as xxx_ID
	-> add system user table, link Trip table to userID (from Clerk)
- pages : Homepage(navigation), MyTrips (include previous work and search bar for quicker search), TripDetail (each single trip), Explore (pending)
- Can skip all "pending" items
- skip the login part under development mode (means to skip clerk part), allowing the data save into local storage, use a parameter "IsDevelop" to control


ask me question for verify, feel free to provide suggestion.
